Oh, they were solidly above average, and life was just peaceful with the only worry being homework. Looking back, those carefree days of childhood still make me smile."

    "At the age of 13 years old, I moved from primary school to Visi Tutor for my IGCSE studies. I made such strong bonds with my close pals, to some I would even consider them as family. I managed to finish my IGCSE in just three years, way quicker than the norm. If I had the chance, I'd totally relive those high school years, as they definitely hold a special place in my heart."

    "I volunteered as a pianist at my local church. Every week, we would gather to jam and practice, pushing ourselves to improve. It was an absolute thrill when we decided to take part in two talent nights and we even snagged first place in our very first show! As my skills grew, I was appointed as the bandleader and have even started teaching little kids how to play the piano."

Being the youngest in my class turned out to be pretty fun, I got to hang out with older folks and learn from their wisdom. I graduated college with an above-average grade, earning myself a scholarship for my university studies."

I learned a lot of things from all sorts of subjects, but it was sound-designing that truly captured my interest, making me realize that being a sound designer for games was my true calling. I got to dive into some cool projects and was pretty proud of the results. I graduated from university with First class honours, thanks to my dedication and hard work."

She had my back since day one, supporting me through the whole journey. Her guidance was priceless, and I seriously can't thank her enough for making this adventure unforgettable. She's the real MVP."

Recognizing that most sound designers in the gaming industry require coding skills, I became determined to dedicate more time to learning this valuable skill set. Python became my first programming language and taught myself the ropes using YouTube tutorials and reading documentation."

    "I landed a gig at Vine Music Studio as a sound designer intern in the media industry, working on those flashy ads you see online like on YouTube. I was a bit bummed that I couldn't find any internships in sound design for games, but hey, the internship turned out to be pretty sweet. After the internship, I stuck around as a part-timer for the extra cash, but I could feel my passion shifting toward coding, slowly but surely."

In just a month, I have learned so much about programming. The BootCamp was intense, with weekly exams and an 8-hour final exam marathon. I met people from diverse backgrounds, and we learned from each other. It was an exhilarating journey packed with thrilling learning experiences. Without a doubt, that month was the best time of my life."

Marking the beginning of my journey being a cadet of 42KL. I met more awesome new friends, each with their own unique background and story, with more things to learn from each other."

    "My passion for sound design for the media was at its lowest, so I ended my gig at Vine Music Studio and I knew it was time to shift gears and fully concentrate on 42KL and coding. It was a big risk since sacrificing this job would mean sacrificing the income that comes with it and I was already struggling financially. But you know what? I'm determined to make it work because this coding journey is something I'm willing to hustle for."

    "Boom! At the age of 21 years old, I finally wrapped up the final project of the core programme and crushed the final exam, becoming the first cadet in 42KL to complete the Core Programme in less than a year. My final project was so good that we even got to showcase it to lecturers, students, the esteemed board of directors, and even representatives of the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA). Now, I'm diving into specialization within 42KL, ready to level up my coding skills even more."
